# Project Description

## Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction

Performed EDA and applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM to detect if a person is prone to a heart attack.

## Mall Customer Segmenation

After preprocessing the data, clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Agglomerative were utilized 
for customer segmentation.
